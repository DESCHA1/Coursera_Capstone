Introduction/Business Problem

Moving to a new city can elicit feelings of depression, anxiety, and loneliness. Foreigners moving to Berlin, in search of a therapist with which to discuss these issues, have historically had a hard time finding a therapist in a timely fashion. Compounding the general city-wide shortage of qualified psychotherapists is the added hardship of finding a therapist that is a native speaker of the language of their country of origin.

Focusing on the sizeable native English-speaking population of Berlin, I will use the tools of machine learning and cluster analysis, in particular, in order to determine the best place to open up a new English-speaking psychotherapeutic practice.
